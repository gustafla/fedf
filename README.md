**Fedora Fighters**

A 2D fighting game made for Gamedev club.

If you got this from github, you only have the "engine" code.

Building requires SDL1.2, SDL_image, SDL_mixer.  
Windows builds require MinGW.  
You're probably gonna have to figure a few things out if you want to build for Windows, especially with some other toolchain...

Yes, some filenames are hardcoded and there is no character/attack scripting, so this isn't that much of an actual engine, sorry.
